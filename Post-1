<p>After a long pause due to the pandemic, 2022 is the year of new tech trends. From the continuous discussion of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techbmc.com/what-is-metaverse/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Metaverse</a>&nbsp;to the increasing popularity of 5G networks, this year, the internet is faster and smarter than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the IDC Worldwide Semiannual Digital Transformation Spending Guide, the global annual spending on technologies and services is about to hit a whopping $2.3 trillion as forecasted. The spending on digital transformation (DX) is at an estimated compound annual growth rate of 17.1% for a period of five years (2019-23). In the post-digital world, along with digital realities, related products and services will be hyper-personalized. And to decipher that, we will require a technology vision that meets the requirements of constantly changing on-demand experiences.</p>

<h3>1. 5G Technology- A Boon For Businesses in 2022</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The term ‘5G’, one of the fastest rising latest technology trends, has been creating a buzz for almost half a decade now and since it has rolled out, it definitely, like its predecessors, has created a revolution of a kind. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobileappdaily.com/2018/10/26/5g-technology-to-arrive-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advent of 5G</a>&nbsp;is one of the most enigmatic existing technologies that are impacting businesses in 2022. Many industry experts have termed 5G as the future of communication and seeing its growth among new trends in technology proves it is true.</p>

<p>“5G wireless networks will support 1,000-fold gains in capacity, connections for at least 100 billion devices and a 10 GB/s individual user experience of extremely low latency and response times, as stated by future trends in technology report by Huawei. “Deployment of these networks will emerge between 2020 and 2030.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most striking achievement of 5G is its speed which is expected to clock at 20 GB/s. Now, how fast are we discussing? Let us take an example of these future technology trends. Suppose you download the contents of an (approx) 5 GB DVD at an average of 50 MB/s. It will take roughly about 13 minutes. Now the same will take barely 2 seconds to download on 5G at top speed.</p>
